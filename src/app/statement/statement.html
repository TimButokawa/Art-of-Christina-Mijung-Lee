            My work explores the space between resilience and vulnerability, ranging from
            the lyrical to the obscene. The work draws from the mundane and absurd
            extraordinariness of the everyday, and is emotive in exploring how our experience in the
            external world manifests internally. In my early work, I explored a cultural identity
            rooted in my ethnic heritage and family history. In my current work, this idea has been
            enlarged through a more introspective search that goes beyond the cultural to the personal
            and spiritual, considering temporality, emotional truth, and what it means to be human.
            The work has opened and developed through a synthesis of varying styles, media,
            sensibilities, and genres. My process involves drawing from a collection of words and
            images that I continuously gather from literature, art, pop culture, the Internet, direct
            experience, and my own writing. I am interested in working with both 2-dimensional and
            3-dimensional forms, and text often takes the form of an object. My interest in text is in
            its conceptual potential â€“ how words can carry multitudes of ideas beyond themselves.
            Images and materials are also used for their loaded content. I aspire to connect by
            communicating meaning. Disparate elements are combined and layered to create multiple
            interpretations through suggesting rather than stating. Though meaning is sometimes
            direct while other times more cryptic, I always want the work to be open to possibilities
            rather than conclusive.
