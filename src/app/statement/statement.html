    <h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
    <div>
        <p>I navigate and negotiate day to day experience by collecting, constructing, and organizing information and objects. I synthesize these strategies into moments that draw from the mundane and the absurd. Disparate materials are gathered and used for their loaded content as well as their formal qualities, and are arranged to form connections. I restrict myself to as few moves as possible to cultivate a direct experience, so that each gesture is meaningful.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>I accumulate materials through my studio practice as well as daily life. I use materials that are fragile and unstable because they mirror what I sometimes consider to be the impossibility of our experience (trying to structure or make sense of things that are unpredictable and out of our control). The raw, low-tech quality of the materials and the process are laid bare; the modest and utilitarian materials also reference the everyday and the extraordinariness of banal experience.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>My impulse to order is deeply intuitive. Because my work is an extension of my thinking, spontaneous actions are put through a more analytical and intentional filter. Both phases reveal a desire to understand, and in that way, the work explores a direct link between contemplation and the handmade object. I want the pieces to be open to possibilities rather than conclusive, so that they act as receptacles for the viewerâ€™s own contemplations.</p>
